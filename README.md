 # Learning summary for Task 1 
 # The data science process:
 A quick outline When a non-technical supervisor asks you to solve a data problem, the description of your task can be quite ambiguous at first. It is up to you, as the data scientist, to translate the task into a concrete problem, figure out how to solve it and present the solution back to all of your stakeholders. We call the steps involved in this workflow the “Data Science Process. ” This process involves several important steps: Frame the problem: Who is your client?What exactly is the client asking you to solve?How can you translate their ambiguous request into a concrete, well-defined problem?Collect the raw data needed to solve the problem: Is this data already available?If so, what parts of the data are useful?If not, what more data do you need?What kind of resources (time, money, infrastructure) would it take to collect this data in a usable form?Process the data (data wrangling): Real, raw data is rarely usable out of the box.

There are errors in data collection, corrupt records, missing values and many other challenges you will have to manage. You will first need to clean the data to convert it to a form that you can further analyze. Explore the data: Once you have cleaned the data, you have to understand the information contained within at a high level. What kinds of obvious trends or correlations do you see in the data?What are the high-level characteristics and are any of them more significant than others?Perform in-depth analysis (machine learning, statistical models, algorithms): This step is usually the meat of your project,where you apply all the cutting-edge machinery of data analysis to unearth high-value insights and predictions.

# History of Machine Learning

Today, machine learning algorithms enable computers to communicate with humans, autonomously drive cars, write and publish sport match reports, and find terrorist suspects. 
Deep dive into the history and learned how data and computers were tested every year to prove that AI will be a boon or threat to society.

Scientists believe a computer will never “think” in the way that a human brain does, and that comparing the computational analysis and algorithms of a computer to the machinations of the human mind is like comparing apples and oranges. Regardless, computers’ abilities to see, understand, and interact with the world around them is growing at a remarkable rate. And as the quantities of data we produce continue to grow exponentially, so will our computers’ ability to process and analyze — and learn from — that data grow and expand.
